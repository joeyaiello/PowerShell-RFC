## Agenda

* PowerShell 7 release update
* Secrets Management update
* PowerShellGet v3 update
* PSEditorServices/VSCode-Extension update
* Jupyter notebook support update
* PSReadline 2.0 GA

## Notes

* PowerShell 7.0 GA is delayed until March 4
    * We felt more comfortable releasing an RC3 to ensure that
* [Secrets Management repo]() is live, please check it out, file feedback
    * Still early enough in the design/development process, your feedback *counts*
    * Preview.2 release of Secrets Management coming next month
* PowerShellGet 3.0 will have a preview release similar to Secrets Management
    * Coming next month, but will not be feature complete in the first preview
    * Install, Uninstall, and Find will be implemented, but we're still improving the UX
    * Works fully side-by-side and on 5.1
* Editor Services / VS Code extension
    * Still planning to move the preview extension branch into the stable extension to coincide with 7.0 GA
    * Decided to take the RC3 opportunity to release one more preview
        * Think of this last preview as an RC
    * If you have any last problems, please file them now
* Jupyter notebook support
    * Jupyter notebooks allow you to create documents with executable, inline code samples
    * Recently shipped integration with [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive)
    * Great for documentation and learning, allows you to give rich context around samples
        * Additionally, samples can be tweaked by users to experiment with the samples
    * Added `$host` support to make the Jupyter experience more consistent with the PowerShell console experience
    * Please file issues in the [.NET Interactive repo]()
        * This includes scenario ideas for how you want to use Jupyter notebooks
* PSReadline 2.0 GA released a couple weeks ago
    * Will be delivered into Windows PowerShell for accessibility purposes
    * We have some ideas for PSReadline 2.1 around improving the interactive experience
    * Try out Dongbo's prototype with fish-like autocompletion
* Working to do some modern shell improvements
    * Tab/auto completion, coloring, formatting
    * Tracking this work in the [GitHub project for Shell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/projects/17)
    * Not sure if this work will work back to 5.1
* PowerShell 7.1 plans, projects, issues, and blogs coming soon
    * 7.1 *will* be moving to .NET 5
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/cmdlet-versions
* REST auto-generation with [AutoRest](https://github.com/azure/autorest)
* PSScheduleJob is being explicitly omitted for usage in the Win PS compat layer in 7.0,
  as it doesn't work given it was never designed to work remotely
* We still have a problem with PS modules trying to load conflicting versions of the same assemblies
    * There's an AssemblyLoadContext in the VS Code extension that isolates some of its own dependencies
      so that they don't conflict with the `Az` modules.
    * Generalizing this to all of PowerShell is difficult, we may explore some opt-in option for
      module developers
* What's going on with 7.0 in the Microsoft Store?
    * Two major issues
        * Virtualization of resources (i.e. the application is in a sandbox)
        * Inability to write to `$PSHome`
    * We believe we've overcome the virtualization problem, but it remains to be seen if there are still limitations
    * The `$PSHome` problem will not be addressed for 7.0,
      but we will look at it for 7.1
