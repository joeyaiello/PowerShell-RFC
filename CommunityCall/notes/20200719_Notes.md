## Agenda

* New releases of PowerShell
  * 7.1.0-preview.5
  * 7.1.0-preview.4
* PowerShellGet 3.0 Preview 6
* https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13162
* Update on updateable help pipeline
* [Q&A](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/257)

## Notes

* PowerShell 7.1 releases snapping to .NET 5 Releases
  * 7.1.0-preview.5 is very minor release to snap to .NET 5 preview
  * Won't necessarily ship every time that .NET 5 ships,
    as some updates aren't applicable to PowerShell
  * If you have PRs you want to ship into PowerShell 7.1, you probably have less time than you think
* [PowerShellGet 3.0 Preview 6 shipped last week](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershellget-3-0-preview-6-release/)
  * Includes updates to publishing, repo search, some other fixes and
  * Another prerelease coming soon
    * fix to Publish-PSResource
    * relative path fixes to repo registration
    * first preview to ship into 7.1 preview
  * Thinking about migration from PSGet 2.x, full blog post coming soon with all the details
    * Created new module called `PowerShellGetCompat` to create mapping from 3.0 semantics back to 2.0 semantics
    * Current thinking is to put this on and included by default with PSGet 3.0 and PS 7.1
    * Put into a separate module so that you can easily remove it, and so we can track it's usage
    * Still very much looking for feedback on all of this
      * (Are you using fully qualified module names? i.e. `PowerShellGet\Install-Module`)
      * Provide feedback in the [PowerShellGet repo](https://github.com/powershell/powershellget)
* Discuss [issue #13162 on splatting enhancements](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13162)
  * We did some reviews on the original RFC0002 that proposed splatting improvements
  * Specifically, we currently throw an error if you use a named parameter that's also included in a splatted hashtable
    ```
    $hash = @{ Name = 'hello' }
    test-function @hash -Name World
    ```
   * Does it make sense for the order to matter in named parameters combined with splatting?
     E.g. `test-function -Name World @hash`
* Update on updateable help pipeline
  * Docs online are being updated, but it's not matching what you see in `Update-Help`
  * We have a new pipeline for building/publishing updateable help and we've moved Windows PowerShell 5.1 "inbox" help over
    * "inbox" == modules owned by the PowerShell Team
    * Windows OS modules (i.e. those for roles/features) will be coming further down the line
    * Also working with Office PowerShell, and then additional teams
  * We'll be moving PowerShell Core 6.x and PowerShell 7.0 help over very soon
  * Currently, about_* topics are not working in Microsoft.PowerShell.Core for 5.1,
    but we're hoping to have them fixed by the end of August
* Update to Cloud Shell rolling out some time next week to enable connection to isolated networks in Azure
  * If you have a private VNet, we can inject a Cloud Shell container there
  * Will be preview for a few weeks, will eventually roll out as GA
* Why not use GitHub Discussions for RFCs?
  * Joey: "primary problems with RFCs today are people-related and not tooling-related"
  * "would rather not move in flight to a new tool before process has stabilized"
  * Steve: "already experimenting with bits of our new process whereby things are starting more in-depth in issues"
* [WinRT assembly discussion](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13042)
  * .NET 5 removed WinRT assemblies, and some PS modules broke in 7.1-preview.4 as a result
  * Assemblies are available on nuget.org, and we've provided that workaround,
    but there's still an open switch on whether we put this burden on module authors or ship those assemblies in 7.1
  * Eventually, we want PSGet 3.1+ to declare Nuget assembly dependencies
* Already an issue for adding GitHub repos as PSGet repos, so go upvote that if you want it :)
* Is it worth it to continue work on FileSystem provider and JSON cmdlets?
  * With many of our other projects going on, we recognize we've been letting some community PRs languish
  * We'll review some of @iSazonov's PRs to see what might be able to fit into 7.1
  * We should probably define in the existing issues how we would want to transition to a "FileSystem v2 provider" (or potentially "JSON v2" cmdlets)
* If you're having Intellisense problems in VS Code with the remote SSH extension,
  make sure to [file an issue in their repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release)
* Why not support YAML by default?
  * We're trying to head in a direction where PS is smaller,
    and have folks use the Gallery for additional modules that they need
  * Today, we can't *remove* JSON/XML support because they've always been there,
    but adding new assemblies isn't something we want to do today
  * We also don't want to pick winners with regards to YAML libraries
* Will Azure Stack and Windows Admin Center support PowerShell 7?
* News on Secret Management
  * Definitely still actively working for the last few months
  * You will see something soon :)
* New Cloud Shell release coming with latest PS versions (and other tools) in the next 2-3 weeks
