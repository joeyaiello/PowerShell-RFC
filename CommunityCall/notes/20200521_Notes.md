# PowerShell Community Call - April 16, 2020

## Agenda

* Latest PS 7.1 preview
  * Experimental `PSNativePSPathResolution` feature
* PSGet 3.0 preview
* Secret Management preview
* 

## Notes

* PS 7.1 preview 3
  * Simultaneously shipping with .NET 5 previews
    * Maximizing support lifecycle of GA releases
    * Windows ARM64 support in preview!
    * Helping to validate new .NET 5 builds through our preview, as well as driving priorities into the .NET team
  * `PSNativePSPathResolution` resolves filesystem provider paths as full paths when passed to native applications
    * E.g. now you can `notepad ~\.npmrc` or `notepad Temp:\foo.ps1` on Windows
* 3rd PSGet 3.0 out this week
  * Added two new params to `Install-PSResource`: `RequiredResource` and `RequiredResourceFile`
  * Next preview release in June will be themed around publishing
    * Last major cmdlet
    * Make sure to file issues at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet
  * Install with `Install-Module -AllowPreRelease PowerShellGet`
  * Some of the migration story from 2.0 to 3.0 is still up in the air
    * Different parameter sets on the two versions
    * Our expectation is for both modules to exist side-by-side
* 3rd Secret Management preview release coming soon ðŸ¤ž
  * Decided to re-evaluate how we're implementing the local secret store on non-Windows
    * Resulted in new security review
  * The ICS file is broke!
    * I'll be fixing it soon
* Questions
  * General outlook on winget, the new package manager announced at Build
    * 
  * Plans to service OpenSSH and SSH-based remoting
    * Right now, our Win32 port of OpenSSH ships as a feature-on-demand in Windows
    * With the next fall release of Windows 10 / Server SAC, we will start regularly updating the inbox OpenSSH release
    * Critical updates will be released via Windows Update (WU)
    * Beta on GitHub is not and will not be supported
    * We've been actively triaging the Win32-OpenSSH issues as well, as some of these got backlogged
    * Still *compatible* with Windows 7 / Server 2008R2, but not officially supported
    * There is an Azure extension for installing OpenSSH server on Azure VMs (including downlevel versions of Windows)
  * Would it be possible to change the env path variable from C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\ to %ProgramFiles%\PowerShell\7\ ?
    * Getting some community help on our MSI, this may be resolved soon
    * Will look into it
  * [Issue on fully-qualified command execution with version number](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/8949)
    * This technically works, but it runs the script block in module scope:

      ```powershell
      Get-Module -ListAvailable PowerShellGet | ? Version -like '2.0.1' | Import-Module
      $moduleInfo = Get-Module PowerShellGet
      & $moduleInfo { Find-Module Az* }
      ```

  * How about PowerShell update cmdlet?
    * Working on both Store-based install and Microsoft Update-based install, and then wrapping one or both with a cmdlet
  * Stability/perf around VS Code extension
    * Top priority for Tyler in getting it fixed, very deep problem
  * Plans for the PowerShell/Modules repo?
    * Working to move some modules in the PowerShell/PowerShell repo into their own repos
    * Had thought about moving all PS Team-owned modules into a single Modules repo
      * Would have been the equivalent of the `corefx` repo
    * However, this made CI and packaging very complicated, so we're actually going to split these into multiple repos
    * May use the Modules repo as a directory for discoverability purposes
  * Where can I get compat info on modules working PowerShell 7
