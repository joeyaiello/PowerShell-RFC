# PowerShell Community Call - January 16, 2020

## Notes

* PowerShell 7 RCs and GA
    * RC.1 released in December
    * GA originally planned for January
    * Delayed GA to February to make room for an RC.2 build
    * RCs are both "go live" supported
* Doc-a-thon
* PowerShell 7.1
    * Will be aligned with .NET 5 shipping roughly towards the end of 2020
    * Expect a blog post with regards to the PowerShell 7.1 release
* VS Code extension
    * Released an extra bugfix release yesterday (1/15) that is coinciding with the 7 GA
    * This is pre-empting a major move from the refactor in Preview to stable
    * Use it! "Preview" is *really* stable, really close to GA
        * Caveat: no support for PS 3.0 or 4.0 in Preview
* Classes
    * Still probably not investing in 7.1
    * Would like to see more info about scenario enablement driven by new classes
* PSGet 3.0 and Secrets Management status
    * Not a ton of progress given the holidays
    * Looking to get previews out shortly for both
* Replacing Windows PowerShell with PowerShell 7
    * "PowerShell 7 is a viable replacement for Windows PowerShell"
        * What we mean here is that *functionally* PowerShell 7 
    * Today, we don't have a direct path to ship 7 inbox in Windows
* Can PS 7 replace Bash on Linux
    * Today, you can use it as the default shell (with `pwsh -l`), but there are some issues
    * *Functionally*, we believe PowerShell is a strong replacement for Bash, but it's still
      better to come in through a Bash/*sh login shell
    * Definitely check out [`PSUnixUtilCompleters`](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSUnixUtilCompleters/0.0.3)
      on the Gallery
* How long will 6.2 be supported?
    * 6.2 will be supported for 6 months after the release of 7.0
    * 6.1 is already out of support
    * 6.x is going away
* PowerShell 7 RC in Cloud Shell?
    * Keep your eyes peeled, probably coming soon
* Any plans to add PS7 to Azure Automation
    * None today, recommendation is to use Azure Functions for PowerShell Core/7
* Plans to continue updating the VS Code extension Preview as an Insiders?
    * Yes :)
* Any plans to support VB?
    * Not today, as we didn't want to bloat the package for a low-usage feature
    * You can use Install-Package or build a module that references those assemblies if you want
* Any discussion with System Center folks?
    * Yes, we're talking to SCCM about module compatibility
    * Not currently talking to any other SC teams
* Is `dispose{}` going into 7.1 quick, or will we wait a while?
    * Earlier the better
* In general, push impactful and breaking changes into previews earlier rather than later
    * This way, we have a chance to pull them out
* Apologies for lack of Nov/Dec published calls, will get that out soon
* You have to create the WinRM configuration with the MSI checkbox, Enable-PSRemoting, or
  the `Install-PSRemoting.ps1` script in `$PSHOME` of PS Core/7
* What's in the new PSReadline Beta?
    * We just shipped the RC of PSReadline, with a GA planned just before 7 GA
    * Biggest change from 1.x -> 2.0 was to remove dependencies on Windows APIs so that PSRL is x-plat
    * That change created some new issues, many with buffer management
    * PSRL 2.0 GA will make its way back into Windows
* If your Windows PowerShell module isn't in system32, make sure to use
  `Import-Module -UseWindowsPowerShell foo`
* As a module author, how can you make it easier to manage Nuget assemblies/dependencies?
    * PSGet 3.0 is intended to make that much easier
* Can 7.0 be a Windows Update update?
    * It *might* be a Microsoft Update (MU) update
