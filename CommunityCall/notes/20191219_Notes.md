        * As always, we welcome contributions in docs for unassigned issues

* PSReadLine 2.0 RC shipped at the same time as PS7 RC
    * PSRL GA is going to ship simultaneously with PS 7 GA
* PowerShell Editor Services / Visual Studio Code PS extension
    * Earlier this week, updated both stable and preview extensions
    * Significantly refactored the extension in the preview branch
    * This stable release is the last before we bring the refactor changes from preview into stable
    * Give preview a try now so we can fix issue going into our major release in January
* PowerShellGet 3.0
    * Major rewrite with new cmdlets and parameter sets
    * Check into [the RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/237) which is still being actively updated
    * Public preview pushed back to January
* Secrets Management module
    * Module that abstracts the management of keys and secrets between multiple key stores
    * Built-in Windows local default provider
    * Still looking into local on other platforms and Azure KeyVault
    * Public preview pushed back to January
    * Looking to internal and external partners to help with implementing providers to make this more valuable
