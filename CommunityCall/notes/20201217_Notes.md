# # PowerShell Community Call - December 17, 2020

## [Agenda](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/272)

* Community PRs and issues triage
* ANSI rendering demos
* SecretManagement / SecretStore RC plan
* Crescendo
* Doc update
* Q&A

## Notes

* 7.2 preview 2 released earlier this week
  * Published a [blog with new features](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-7-2-preview-2-release/)
  * Doing our best to merge experimental features as soon as possible,
    so that they have a chance to stabilize before GA in ~Nov 2021
* Community PR and issue triage
  * Steve and Joey have been triaging issues into `7.2-Consider` milestone
  * Committee has been triaging open PRs into `Backport-7.2.x-Consider`
  * None of these are *committed*, but we want to spend PowerShell Team time
    to investigate anything marked with this milestone and label
  * Ultimately, we'd like to make a call one way or the other for the majority
    of these issues and PRs
  * Also working to merge style changes as early as possible to avoid merge
    conflicts and randomization
  * Will eventually cut off code cleanup changes for the 7.2 release
  * We also don't want to take style changes just because they *can* be made
  * Often, there's undefined behavior that may be unexpectedly changed via
    code cleanup changes
  * If there's not clear benefit or absolute confidence in a code cleanup change
    we may reject it
* ANSI rendering and `$PSStyle` demo
  * New `$PSStyle` variable encapsulates `$Host.PrivateData` and other text formatting
  * Also have the ability to change the behavior whereby VT100/ANSI codes get
    used or stripped within the pipeline
  * In preview.3, we've colorized more cmdlet output based on the `$PSStyle` changes
    (e.g. `$PSStyle.FileInfo` where you can format arbitrary file extensions)
  * In preview.3, Steve has also reworked the progress bar so that it doesn't
    take up a significant portion of the top of the console buffer,
    but rather shows a one-line progress bar just below the command invocation
    * Can also have multiple progress bars going at once
* SecretManagement / SecretStore RC plan
  * Thank you for all the early feedback!
  * Paul has addressed any major issues that have been filed in the repos
  * We plan on having an RC in January, followed by a GA based on user feedback
* Crescendo
  * First preview release earlier in December
  * Check out more info in the [release blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-crescendo-preview-1/)
  * Crescendo is a utility that allows you to leverage native utilities as if
    they were PowerShell commands
  * Chose JSON over PSD1 today because of the ability to have a schema
  * `Handler` is custom logic that handles output from native utilities
  * Our desire is for folks to publish modules that wrap various utilities to
    the PowerShell Gallery where folks can leverage the collaboration of others
  * Crescendo-generated modules will be compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1
  * Motivation was to wrap utilities in a more general, standardized way
  * Not intended to replace the direct invocation of native utilities within PS
  * Will be still be improving PS' ability to invoke native utilities...natively
* Doc updates
  * Added some information to the [PowerShell-Docs contributor guide](https://aka.ms/PSDocsContributor),
    including some info about localization and how it's handled
  * Updated [PowerShell 7.1 release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-71) with more actionable info
  * All PowerShell-Docs content and SCCM content is now on new updateable help pipeline
* Q&A
  * What will happen with the VS Code extension now that Tyler has left the team?
    * Rob will be the primary engineer on the extension, and we will be backfilling
      Tyler's role on the team with a new engineer at some point in the future
    * Immediate goal is to address the stability issues we've been seeing
  * Hosting PS 7 on Microsoft update / Download Catalog is a very high priority
    for us in the 7.2 timeframe
  * Native call operator is also a priority in 7.2, and we will be updating that issue as our
    thinking evolves
  * When is OpenSSH going to be updated in Windows?
    * You can use Windows Insider for update bits today
  * Can we have better epic/theme planning [like .NET](https://themesof.net)
    * Unfortunately, we're not *quite* as organized from a planning perspective as .NET
    * At minimum, we're working on a meta-issue for the 7.2 milestone for PS/PS,
      as well as a roadmap blog post for the 7.2 timeframe that includes other projects
  * We will look into a new stable release of VS Code that at minimum includes a new PSSA
  * We will be updating http://aka.ms/psmodulecompat to include more modules in the future
  * 7.2 will be an LTS release
    * We'll investigate a bug around which versions you're being notified on with regards to updates
  * Will copying colorized terminal output copy the ANSI escape sequences
    * Technically controlled by the terminal, but in most cases, no
  * If the new [Microsoft Graph modules](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell)
    do not meet your needs as a Core-compatible replacement for AzureAD, please file issues on that repo
  * Still have a desire to ship `PSUnixCompleters` as part of PS 7.2
  * Please file feedback in the Feedback Hub around the WindowsUpdateProvider module not working
* Thanks for an awesome year in PowerShell and have a happy holiday!
