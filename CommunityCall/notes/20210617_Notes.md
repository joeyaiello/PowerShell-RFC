## Notes

* Working Groups 
  * Congrats to community folks we've added to Engine, Cmdlet, and DevEx WGs
  * Created a Discord server for higher bandwidth conversations
    * Some aspects may be read-only or private still
* PowerShell 7.2 preview 7
  * If all goes well ðŸ¤ž, we'll be releasing today (otherwise, Monday)
  * `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` module not shipping in preview for first time
    * Not indicative of our investment in DSC, just to decouple lifecycles between
      PowerShell and DSC
  * v2 module shipping on Gallery, v3 module should be there very soon (if not already)
* [Microsoft Update support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/preview-updating-powershell-7-2-with-microsoft-update/)
  * Supports updates only from 7.2 preview 5 or 6
  * If you want to try this out, don't update to preview 7 manually!
  * Should be available in ~1 week (watch @PowerShell_Team for tweets)
  * Today, you need to add a reg key, but in the future this won't be necessary
  * Can also do a clean install with a different reg key if you have no preview at all
  * For this preview, we're currently only going back to Windows 10/Server RS3+
    * If you have a strong need for something earlier,
      please give us context on that in the discussion linked from the blog
* PowerShellGet 3.0
  * Working on refactor of cmdlets and test coverage
  * Done with refactoring Get-InstalledPSResource, Uninstall-PSResource, and Publish-PSResource
  * Very close to Find-, Install-, Save- and Update-
  * Pushing to release in the next few weeks
  * Backwards compatibility is a top priority
  * Keep your eyes peeled for a blog post
  * DSC resource for PowerShellGet 3.0?
    * We include some resource in 3.0 today, but they made need to be refactored
    * Discussion on moving PSGet DSC resources out to their own module
      * File or comment on issues to let us know what you think about this!
* VSCode extension
  * Just launched a [new stable release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-for-visual-studio-code-may-2021-update/)
  * A lot of the work happening in `PowerShellEditorServices` to improve stability and performance
    * Check GitHub Projects for [Debug Reliability](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/projects/9)
      and [Startup Reliability](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/projects/8)
  * Even newer preview out as of today (6/17) to fix some issues in Windows PowerShell 5.1
  * Making some improvements to async
  * Lastly, will hook the debugger back up
  * Doubled our release cadence compared to the past 6 months!
  * We understand there's lots of new features folks are requesting,
    but the focus right now is still on stability and perf
  * Keep track of even more of our priorities with
    [GitHub Projects on `vscode-powershell`](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/projects)
* Justin Grote demoing [PowerConfig](https://github.com/JustinGrote/PowerConfig)
  * Wrapper around ASP.NET Configuration
  * Takes input of YAML, JSON, TOML, PSD1 and more,
    and makes hashtables out of them
  * You simply pipe configuration file paths to PowerConfig cmdlets,
    and they'll be processed in the order you add them
    (including to clobber existing key/value pairs)
  * You can even add to the configs via environment variables!
* Q&A
  * Should we lock all old and/or closed threads?
