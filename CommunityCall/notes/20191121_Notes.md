* Releases (preview)
    * 7.0-preview.6 release should come out today
        * Blog post coming out with some of the new features coinciding with the release
        * Experimental feature for Unix stat
        * Windows PowerShell wrapper feature (`Import-Module -UseWindowsPowerShell foo`)
        * Completion of the null conditional operators
    * Release candidate targeting next month pending the .NET Core 3.1 GA
        * Still a couple pending PRs (e.g. `ConvertFrom-SecureString -AsPlaintext`)
          that could make their way RC
    * Should GA in January pending no major blockers in RC
    * 7.1 release after that, anything not making RC will slip to that
* PowerShell 7.1
    * Hoping to have first preview of 7.1 coinciding with 7.0 GA
    * Moving off of a bi-annual schedule to align with .NET's annual lifecycle
    * 7.0 is an LTS because it's also aligned with .NET's support lifecycle
        * 7.1 is not an LTS for the same reason
* Questions
    * Will the Native DLL resolver make it in?
        * Seems low-risk, but ultimately we need the area experts to finish their code reviews
    * Large Twitter thread on compiling a PS script into a binary
        * Difficult to do because of dynamic resolution, late-binding, autoloading,
          picking things up off the module path, etc.
        * PowerShell scripts would have to look very different in order for them to be beneficially
          compiled ahead-of-time
        * PSLambda allows you to specify an ahead-of-time "delegate thing" in PS
    * Automate browser testing with `Selenium` module
    * How else can we improve performance without ahead-of-time?
        * Looked at some core features, and done some small changes
        * Some of those core features are also heavily entwined with PowerShell's behavior
        * Post-7.0, we want to look at more perf opportunities
            * E.g. pipeline, parameter binder, dot-sourcing
    * Why aren't my preview experimental features turned on by default?
        * If you've generated a `config.json` at all, you'll need to delete it for us to regenerate
          a new one with the enabled experimental features
        * Optionally, you can run `Enable-ExperimentalFeature`
    * Known issue with piping to native commands
        * We want to look at this in 7.1
        * Will also look at redirection operator `<`
    * Hoping to have preview of SecretManagement in Nov/Dec
    * Additionally an *early* PowerShellGet 3.0 preview in Dec (likely only `Find-PSResource`)
* Ignite 2019
    * Fantastic trip, thank you to everyone that came
    * For those that didn't make it, recordings are available online
        * We'd like to put all these presentations in one place in the docs, stay tuned
        * Joey will also look at posting demos online (they weren't captured well in the video)
* New [PS Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/powershell/powershell-docs/wiki)
    * Intention is to lower the barrier of entry to writing useful information
    * Sometimes information doesn't quite belong in official documentation
* Upgrade to the PowerShell preview extension!
    * PSReadline support
    * Massive refactor for stability and performance reasons
    * Already some known issues that have been fixed in the next preview
        * E.g. an `@` showing up in your console
    * Want to bring preview into the stable extension in January
    * https://github.com/powershell/vscode-powershell
    * [Roadmap blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-editor-services-roadmap/)
* Telemetry
    * Check out https://aka.ms/PSGitHubBI for our awesome numbers
* Demos
    * Unix stat properties
        * `(Get-Item $Path).UnixStat` now returns the Unix mode
          (user, group, directory vs. file vs. etc., etc.)
        * Please disable experimental features if you don't like them
            * We get telemetry that tells us you don't like them
    * New module published by Mike Batista on using WSL from PS in Windows
        * Also auto-generates completions from Bash "API" for completions
        * Rob published [`PSUnixUtilCompleters`](https://github.com/rjmholt/PSUnixUtilCompleters)
          to generalize this completion functionality across Unix environments
        * If installed, now you can tab complete native binaries on Unix
            * On zsh, you even get tooltips using `MenuComplete` (`Shift+Tab` by default)
    * Will have a blog published about Windows module compatibility
