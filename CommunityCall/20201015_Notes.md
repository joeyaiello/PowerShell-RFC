## Notes

- Next community call will be 11/12 (second Thursday of November)
- Make sure to checkout https://twitch.tv/devopsorg for PWSH24 conference
- Last week, we had a partial PowerShell Gallery outage
    - Resulted in extremely low availability, inability to install modules or access website
    - Still working through the issue, as it's having some intermittent problems
    - Also still need to fix the Gallery statistics, which are currently unavailable
- 7.1 RC.1 is out, RC.2 coming this month
    - We're slightly behind .NET 5 RCs, but we hope to catch back up with GA in November
    - `master` branch in PS/PS is effectively 7.2 at this point
    - In previous releases, we took large amounts of code cleanup and churn at the beginning of
      preview cycles
    - May take some high-profile fixes between RC and GA, but they will be limited
    - Our goal is also to take experimental and feature code early in the 7.2 preview lifecycle,
      with the goal of stabilizing this code in the second half of the 7.2 preview lifecycle
- Team game day: Among Us
    - 10 person maximum, @Steve_MSFT will post the lobby code on Twitter for community folks to join
- Working Groups blog
    - Shift towards decentralization of issue triage, PR reviews, feature RFC reviews
- KeyChain vault extension demo
    - MSFT-internal for SecretManagement Bug Bash last Friday
    - Steve wrote a macOS keychain extension that uses the native OS support for encrypting secrets
    - macOS keychain extension is not supported by the team, just a personal project from Steve
    - Hashtables are supported in SM so that you can splat parameters with secrets in them
    - The extension was very easy to write, most code was written in a couple days by leveraging
      /usr/bin/security
- PSReadLine update and demo
    - Predictive IntelliSense RFC has been published: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/262
    - Please give us your feedback
    - Download latest PSReadline beta with `Install-Module PSReadLine -AllowPreRelease -Force`
      and `Set-PSReadlineOption -PredictionSource History` to enable history-based predictions
    - You can change the color of the inline prediction with
      `Set-PSReadlineOption -Colors = @{Prediction = <color value>}`
    - F2 (configurable) gives you a dynamic ListView of all possible predictions
    - Also going to support first- and third-party plugins that support additional predictions
    - E.g. we're working with the Azure PS team to provide ML-based completions around Azure scenarios
    - Will also be working to move predictions into VS Code during the 7.2 timeframe
- Hacktoberfest
    - Some changes (like adding a topic) to Hacktoberfest all up in order to combat spam PRs
    - Browse through [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
      to find issues that qualify for Hacktoberfest rewards
    - You will see `Hacktoberfest-Approved` label get added for those PRs which qualify
- Console GUI tool updates
    - Out-ConosleGridView works great for console-only environments like Cloud Shell
    - Includes search filter, Tab to go down to list, Space to check items in the collection,
      and Enter passes items to the pipeline
    - Also includes mouse support
- Women in PowerShell and DevOps event 1 week from today (10/22)
    - Register at https://aka.ms/WomenInDevOpsEvent
- Q&A
    - Is there a PSScriptAnalyzer for binary modules?
      - Haven't implemented anything around that, but it would be very useful
      - However, PSSA is really geared towards PS script today, would be a significant effort
    - What is the plan for the module system to support Semantic Version?
        - Difficulty comes with our desire to support downlevel,
        and the fact that updates are needed to the module system directly
    - Progress on PSGet 3.0?
        - Shipped preview.10 of 3.0 last month
        - Focus has been on issues related to the Gallery over PSGet for the last few weeks
        - Minimum of 3 more previews before we go to GA
        - Also working on PowerShellGetCompat module for back-compat with PSGet 2.x cmdlet surface area
        - [`3.0-Resolved` milestone](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0-Resolved) are blocking issues we're committed to resolving in 3.0 GA
    - Are working groups only PS/PS or all other PS repos?
        - Today, only PS/PS and other repos that ship code into PS package, but we could expand in the future
        - We'd like to operationalize WGs for just PS team members by end of calendar year
        - Will also start to reach out to high-profile contributors to gauge interest in joining WGs over the next few months
    - What happened with work to improve native app compatiblity in 7.1?
        - Issues that come to mind: argument parsing for native apps and native command proxy generation
        - Argument parsing has an experimental PR out, but we are worried about backwards compatibility, so this won't ship until 7.2
        - Native Command Proxy Generator is a way to wrap native apps with cmdlets that emit objects, support tab completion, integrates with help, and more
        - The `set -e` scenario is one where we reconcile errors produced by native apps with the native PS error stream and $error
